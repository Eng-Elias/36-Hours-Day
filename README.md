# 36-Hours-Day

Time management (Web + Desktop + Mobile) app which deals with every day as 36 hours instead of 24.

## Introduction

The "36-Hours Day" app is a unique time management tool that challenges the traditional 24-hour day by expanding it into 36 hours. This app is designed to offer a novel perspective on time and encourage users to think differently about how they allocate their hours. It's not just a clock; it's a time management experience.

## Features

### 1. Expand Your Day to 36 Hours

This app transforms your daily timeline from the standard 24 hours to an extended 36-hour day. By doing so, it encourages you to rethink how you structure your time and what you can accomplish in a day.

### 2. Reverse Clock Movement

In the "36-Hours Day" app, time appears to move backward, creating a unique and somewhat surreal experience. This reversal of the clock's movement is intended to make you feel as though time is slipping away, emphasizing the importance of making the most of your day.

### 3. Time Management Tool

Use this app as a tool to help you manage your time more effectively. Whether you're a student, professional, or just someone interested in optimizing your daily routine, the "36-Hours Day" app provides a new perspective on time allocation.

### 4. Gain a Fresh Perspective

By adopting the 36-hour day concept, you can gain a fresh perspective on time management. This app encourages you to prioritize tasks, set goals, and be more productive within an extended timeframe.

## New Features

### 5. Passed Time Speaking Feature

We're excited to introduce the "Passed Time Speaking" feature. Now, the app can audibly announce the elapsed time, providing you with a unique way to stay aware of your day's progression.
